`next-data-pipe` is a small lib that wraps up `dipe (data-pipe)` and provides some additional utilies such as (for example in Next.js by lifting static props).


## Why would I need this?
This library works perfectly in combination with the [next-data-hooks](https://) library.

It works by lifliting up all the boilerplate needed for processing static or server data from props to pre-configured processors callbacks.

## Installation ðŸ”§
```bash
npm install -S next-data-pipe

or 

yarn add next-data-pipe
```

## Usage ðŸ’¡

This library works as an etension of the `data-pipe` library, and provides some utilities build in for Next.js projects.

```js
// example.config.js
const { LocalFilesPostProcessor } = require('dipe/processors');

const config = {
  articles: {
    processors: [
      () => {},
      LocalFilesPostProcessor,
    ]
  }
};

export default config;
```

We also expose a `useConfig` utiltiy used to return a direct link to the config file.
To use that function it's necessary to first configure the webpack config to properly resolve the config file previously created.

```js
// next.config.js
const { resolveConfig } = require('next-data-pipe');
module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, options) => {
    return resolveConfig(config, { configFilePath: './example.config.js' })
  },
}
```

And then the actual implementation will look just like:

```js
import { getConfig } from 'next-data-pipe';
import { readData } from 'dipe';

const articles = getConfig('articles');
let { data, errors } = readData(articles, {});
```

> You can totally skip this part and just use the `dipe` package (as shown below):

```js
import { readData } from 'dipe';
let { data, errors } = readData({
  processors: [],
}, {});

// or 
import config from '../example.config.js';
let { data, errors } = readData(config.articles, {});
```

See the example in this repo for some ideas on how to organize your data using preconfigured processors.
